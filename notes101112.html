<h5>Election data</h5>

<p>Using the Ohio election results linked below, we copied the 2010 Senate results, 2008 presidential results and 2006 Senate results by county and pasted them into the same spreadsheet. There we cleaned things up a bit by removing the third-party candidates and checking to see whether the counties lined up from year to year (we did this by using a formula such as =A2=D2, if the two county columns were A and D).</p>
<p>Then we moved on to adding a column for each election to determine whether the Democrat won that county. We did this by using a formula such as =(B2-C2)>0, where B is the Democratic result and C is the Republican result. If the Democrat received more votes, the value of that formula would be TRUE, otherwise it would be FALSE. Then we could use that column to filter (ask questions) of the data, such as: "Which counties did the Democrat win in 2006 and 2008 but lose in 2010?"</p>
<p>We also calculated the percent of total that each county represented for the 2010 race, so we could see that none of Ohio's counties accounted for even 10% of Rob Portman's vote total. Doing these types of calculations can show which counties are truly electorally competitive (and worth fighting for) and where the margins of victory or defeat are.</p>

<h5>Assignments for October 18</h5>

<p><strong>First Critique</strong>: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-09-17-little-used-airports_N.htm">USA Today story on federal funding for smaller airports</a> (and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-09-16-airport-map_N.htm">accompanying map</a>). In reviewing this material, pay particular attention to how data drives the story and how the reporters used *and* explained it. Would you have done the same? Did they pay too much attention to some aspects and not enough to others? Was it clear to you what they did to arrive at their conclusions? Please critique both the story and map in at least 400 words. When in doubt about what to say, be specific. Don't say, "I liked it." Tell me why.</p>

<p><strong>Excel</strong>: Download <a href="http://apps.sos.wv.gov/elections/results/readfile.aspx?path=OC84LVN0YXRlQ291bnR5VG90YWxzLmNzdg==">this CSV of West Virginia 2012 primary results</a> and copy OFFICIAL county-level primary results for President Obama and Joe Manchin (U.S. Senate race) into a separate sheet, so that each county is a row and the vote totals and percentages for both candidates are among the columns (so you'll have something like ObamaVotes, TotalVotes and ObamaPct, and ManchinVotes, TotalSenateVotes and ManchinPct). Be sure to save your file as an XLS file, not a CSV, then answer these questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In which counties did President Obama receive his highest and lowest percentages? (Answer: Jefferson and Mingo, respectively)</li>
  <li>How many counties did President Obama receive less than 50% of the primary vote? (Answer: 10 - Boone, Clay, Gilmer, Hardy, Lincoln, Logan, Mingo, Tucker, Webster, Wyoming)</li>
  <li>What was the largest difference in the number of votes between Manchin and Obama? Which county? (Answer: Logan, 3,953 votes)</li>
  <li>What was the largest percentage difference between Manchin and Obama? Which county? (Answer: Mingo, 51.8%)</li>
  <li>Did President Obama receive a larger percentage of the vote than Manchin in any counties? Which ones? (Answer: 3 - Jefferson, Kanawha and Monongalia)</li>
</ol>

<p>Email me (dwillis@gmail.com) your critique, Excel file and answers by 6 p.m. on Oct. 18. We won't have class that night, but your assignments are due then.</p>
