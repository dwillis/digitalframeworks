<h5>Assignments for Nov. 29</h5>

<strong>SQLite:</strong>
<p>If you haven't already done so, put your election results tables into a single combined table, perhaps called results. You'll need to add a year column if there's not already one there to distinguish one year's elections from another. If your results have candidate names as columns (rather than in the rows), then change the header to dem_votes and rep_votes to make them generic across elections.</p>
  <p>You can do this in excel and then re-import, or you can pick one of your tables and make that the new "master" table and copy the others into it, assuming that they have the same fields. Be sure to add a year column to both the table you're copying from and into. Then, if they have the exact same fields, you can do this, assuming that my results table is the one that will contain all of the data, and results_2010 has just 2010 data:
  <code>INSERT INTO results SELECT * from results_2010</code><p>
  <p>Then add a counties table listing the counties in your state. You may want to create this by hand, or from doing a group by query from your results, like so (assuming that your results table has a field called "county"):
    
    <code>CREATE TABLE counties AS
          SELECT county
          FROM results
          GROUP BY county
          ORDER BY county</code></p>

  <p>Here's what we're shooting for for Nov. 29, the next time we meet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add 2012 data for statewide races (President/Gov/US Senate as applicable).</li>
  <li>Which counties are the battleground counties (have the lowest margins between Dem/GOP) in statewide elections (President/Gov/US Senate)?</li>
  <li>Which counties are not competitive in statewide races (where one party has had at least twice the votes of the other party in a statewide contest since 2007)?</li>
  <li>Add these fields to your counties table FOR ONLY THE 5 MOST COMPETITIVE COUNTIES: 18_to_24 and 65_older, male, female. Using demographic data from the Census (Factfinder, via Fast Facts for Congress), populate those columns. Are those 5 counties similar in these demographic categories?</li>
  <li>Locate and import a table of the most recent voter registration statistics for your state, by county (or locality for Virginia)</li>
</ol>

<p>Please don't hesitate to contact me when you run into issues. Send the SQLite database to me by email (you may need to compress/zip it first). Put the SQL queries, and your results, in your log and send that along, too.</p>
