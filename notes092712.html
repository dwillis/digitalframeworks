<h5>Notes</h5>

  <p>Tonight we learned a bit about each other and what the class will be about. A couple of key points to remember: while the class is about learning how to work with data, you don't have to become a complete data geek (like your instructor) to be successful. And we won't be writing stories here: this class is about the process, so the final project will be a story memo that describes your reporting process.</p>
  <p>I spoke about data being not just numbers, but also text, like the contents of a speech, and we walked through a little data modeling of the State of the Union text (link below). This modeling can be really helpful when trying to organize unstructured data into a format that we can then use for analysis. It's a way of focusing on the key pieces of information.</p>
  <p>We also talked about learning to interview data just like any other source. You'll want to do your research before you start asking the serious questions, and know about the data's strengths and flaws before you do. We have several primary tools for exploring and interviewing data. The first one we'll use is Excel, which I like to call the gateway drug of data reporting. With Excel we can introduce ourselves to data through sorting and filtering, so that we can see the outliers, what's missing and more. Bear in mind that when you are interviewing data that "no results" can be a perfectly valid answer to a question (it may be a sign that you asked the wrong question, too).</p>

<h6>Data Modeling in Excel</h6>

<p>This <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/committee_info/oal.aspx">House committee assignment roster</a>, can you reorganize a few rows of this in Excel so that it is more useful, so that you can ask specific questions of it?</p>

<h6>Data Modeling in Excel, Part 2</h6>

<p>Pick three professors from <a href="http://elliott.gwu.edu/faculty/fulltime.cfm">this list</a>. How would you model their information in Excel? You'll want to narrow it down to common types of information about them and you probably won't want to model everything.</p>
